# IMDB-Sentiment-Analysis-with-Tensorflow-Keras-Neural-Network
I used IMDB data file in this project.  I tried to classify the reviews of the films by using a word index which is built before. I used Tensorflow and Keras and build a Neural Network Model.  My model has .95 accuracy score and .88 validation score. I tried some different model with different functon and different layer.
